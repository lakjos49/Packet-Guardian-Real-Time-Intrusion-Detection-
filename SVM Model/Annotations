1. live_capture_gan _svm
    Hybrid NIDS with One-Class SVM and GAN Discriminator

This script implements a real-time hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of detecting both known and unknown attacks in network traffic. It integrates multiple detection strategies: signature-based filtering, flooding detection, One-Class SVM anomaly detection, and GAN-based validation.

Core Components and Functionalities:

Packet Capture
Supports both live traffic capture (via Scapy's sniff) and offline .pcap file analysis (via rdpcap).

Feature Extraction
Extracts key features from each packet including length, protocol number, source IP, destination IP, and timestamp.

Signature-Based Detection
Quickly identifies benign packets using protocol-specific size rules.

Flood Detection
Monitors packet rates per destination and protocol over a sliding time window to detect DoS-style flooding behavior.

Anomaly Detection using One-Class SVM
Detects statistical anomalies in traffic using a trained One-Class SVM model. Packet features are scaled using a standard scaler before classification.

False Positive Filtering via GAN Discriminator
If a packet is marked anomalous, a trained GAN discriminator model is used to validate the anomaly and reduce false positives.

Attack Classification and Mitigation Guidance
Malicious packets are mapped to specific attack types such as TCP SYN Flood, UDP Flood, or ICMP Anomaly. Suggested mitigation strategies are provided for each.

Logging and Reporting
Each packet is logged with its features, classification result, GAN score, and any associated attack information. Results are saved as CSV files with timestamped filenames.

Safety Scoring
Calculates an overall safety score based on the proportion of malicious packets and uncommon protocol usage in the traffic.

Visualization
Generates histograms and bar plots to visualize packet length distribution, protocol usage, and benign vs. malicious traffic classification.

Requirements:

A trained One-Class SVM model (model1.pkl)

Corresponding scaler (scaler1.pkl)

A GAN discriminator model (gan_discriminator.h5)

This system is suitable for lightweight real-time deployment and offline traffic analysis. It is modular and can be easily extended with additional detection logic or visualization tools.

2. training_model_svm
   One-Class SVM Training Script for NIDS

This script generates synthetic benign network traffic data and trains a One-Class SVM model to detect anomalies. It simulates realistic packet lengths and protocol distributions for common protocols (ICMP, TCP, UDP) and uses this data to create a baseline of normal behavior.

Functionality Overview:

Data Simulation:

Generates 500 samples of packet lengths drawn from a normal distribution (mean = 100, std = 20).

Randomly assigns protocol numbers (1 = ICMP, 6 = TCP, 17 = UDP) to mimic realistic traffic.

Feature Scaling:

Standardizes the features using StandardScaler to normalize the input before training.

Model Training:

Trains a One-Class SVM using RBF kernel with gamma='auto' and nu=0.05 to model the benign behavior.

Model Saving:

Saves the trained One-Class SVM model (model1.pkl) and the associated scaler (scaler1.pkl) into a model/ directory using joblib.

The generated model and scaler are used later in the NIDS system for anomaly detection on real or captured packet data.
