# Packet-Guardian-Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-
This project implements a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using multiple machine learning models to classify network traffic as benign or malicious in real-time. The system utilizes Scapy for packet capture and feature extraction, along with Isolation Forest and a GAN discriminator for anomaly detection
